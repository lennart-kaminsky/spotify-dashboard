# i still skip over songs - Spotify Dashboard

This is a spotify dashboard that shows your listening habits such as top artists, top tracks and the songs you recently listened to.

For now you can only sign up on [istillskipoversongs.com](https://www.istillskipoversongs.com/) after I added your spotify account's mail address manually as the app is in [spotify developer mode](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes). I will request extended quota mode so that everyone can check it out without asking me before.

Alternatively you can clone this repo, create a spotify app yourself and run the app locally. For more info check below.

## About

I always wanted to do a project with the Spotify API because I enjoy music a lot and think it's a great project for trying new tools and improving skills. I kept a simple design so I could focus even more on details and user experience.

Some things I did for better UX/UI:

- storing scroll positions and filter settings of single components 
- loading skeletons
- responsive pages and components
- text carousel for longer song titles in the player component (with custom hook for checking if an element has overflow)
- colour modes
- 404 page

From time to time I also worked on performance and reduced the amount of API calls that are made while using the app. So in the end i chose to fetch all the data of the top tracks and artists once when loading the app because during the time of exploring the dashboard this data most likely won't change.

## Running the app locally

You can also clone the repository and run the app locally. But to do so you need to do the following things in advance:

1. Go to the [Spotify for Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create a new app
    - Choose a name for your app and write a short description
    - Website: http://localhost:3000/
    - Redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify
    - put your âœ… on Web API
2. In your repository add the `.env.local`-file with the following variables:
     - ```
       NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/
       NEXTAUTH_SECRET= 
       SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
       SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
       SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify
       ```
    - as [next auth secret](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options) you can use a random string
    - you find your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret under Spotify for Developers - Dashboard - Your app - Settings
3. Install the app locally ( `npm i` )
4. Run the development server ( `npm run dev` )
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
